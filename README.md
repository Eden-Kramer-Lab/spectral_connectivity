### What is spectral_connectivity?

`spectral_connectivity` is a Python software package that computes multitaper spectral estimates and frequency-domain brain connectivity measures such as coherence, spectral granger causality, and the phase lag index using the multitaper Fourier transform. Although there are other Python packages that do this (see [nitime](https://github.com/nipy/nitime) and [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python)), `spectral_connectivity` has several differences:

+ it is designed to handle multiple time series at once
+ it caches frequently computed quantities such as the cross-spectral matrix and minimum-phase-decomposition, so that connectivity measures that use the same processing steps can be more quickly computed.
+ it decouples the time-frequency transform and the connectivity measures so that if you already have a preferred way of computing Fourier coefficients (i.e. from a wavelet transform), you can use that instead.
+ it implements the non-parametric version of the spectral granger causality in Python.
+ it implements the canonical coherence, which can
efficiently summarize brain-area level coherences from multielectrode recordings.
+ easier user interface for the multitaper fourier transform
+ all function are GPU-enabled if `cupy` is installed and the environmental variable `SPECTRAL_CONNECTIVITY_ENABLE_GPU` is set to 'true'.

### Tutorials

See the following notebooks for more information on how to use the package:

+ [Tutorial](examples/Intro_tutorial.ipynb)
+ [Usage Examples](examples/Tutorial_On_Simulated_Examples.ipynb)
+ [More Usage Examples](examples/Tutorial_Using_Paper_Examples.ipynb)

### Usage Example

```python
from spectral_connectivity import Multitaper, Connectivity

# Compute multitaper spectral estimate
m = Multitaper(time_series=signals,
               sampling_frequency=sampling_frequency,
               time_halfbandwidth_product=time_halfbandwidth_product,
               time_window_duration=0.060,
               time_window_step=0.060,
               start_time=time[0])

# Sets up computing connectivity measures/power from multitaper spectral estimate
c = Connectivity.from_multitaper(m)

# Here are a couple of examples
power = c.power() # spectral power
coherence = c.coherence_magnitude()
weighted_phase_lag_index = c.weighted_phase_lag_index()
canonical_coherence = c.canonical_coherence(brain_area_labels)
```
