I'm working on the spectral_connectivity project.

Start now by reading the files and telling me which task you'll work on first.

Your workflow MUST be:

1. First, read these files IN ORDER:
   - CLAUDE.md (implementation guide)
   - TASKS.md (current tasks)

2. Find the FIRST unchecked [ ] task in TASKS.md

3. For EVERY feature, follow TDD:
   a. Create the TEST file first
   b. Run the test and verify it FAILS
   c. Only then create the implementation
   d. Run test until it PASSES
   e. Apply review agents (spectral-code-reviewer, scientific-ux-reviewer)
   f. Refactor for clarity and efficiency based on feedback
   g. Add/Update docstrings and types (numpy docstring format).

4. Update TASKS.md checkboxes as you complete items.

5. Update SCRATCHPAD.md with notes and CHANGELOG.md with changes.

6. Commit frequently with messages like "feat(F24): implement error handling"
