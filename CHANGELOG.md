and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- CHANGELOG.md to track version changes following Keep a Changelog format
- Ruff linter configuration for faster, more comprehensive Python linting
- Enhanced package metadata with additional project URLs (Changelog, Source Code, Issue Tracker)
- Modern unified CI/CD workflow (`release.yml`) with automated PyPI publishing
- Support for Python 3.13
- Comprehensive parameter validation to `Multitaper` class:
  - Validates `sampling_frequency > 0` with domain-specific examples (EEG, LFP, fMRI)
  - Validates `time_halfbandwidth_product >= 1` with physical meaning explanation
  - Validates `time_window_duration > 0` (when provided) with frequency resolution formula
  - Validates `time_window_step > 0` (when provided) with overlap guidance
  - Warns when `time_halfbandwidth_product > 10` (unusually large, performance impact)
  - Warns when `time_window_step > time_window_duration` (creates data gaps)
  - Warns when data appears transposed (`n_time < n_signals`)
  - Warns when input contains NaN or Inf values with recovery suggestions
- Input shape validation to `Connectivity` class:
  - Requires 5D `fourier_coefficients` with clear error messages
  - Validates minimum 2 signals for connectivity analysis
  - Warns on NaN/Inf values in Fourier coefficients
- `prepare_time_series()` helper function for safe dimension handling:
  - Converts 1D/2D arrays to required 3D format
  - Explicit `axis` parameter to clarify dimension meaning
  - Prevents ambiguous dimension interpretation
- Enhanced error messages following WHAT/WHY/HOW pattern throughout
- 3D input requirement for `Multitaper` class to eliminate dimension ambiguity

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Minimum Python version raised from 3.9 to 3.10
- Migrated from flake8 to ruff for linting (100x faster, replaces flake8, isort, pydocstyle)
- Updated dependency pins: numpy>=1.24, scipy>=1.10, xarray>=2023.1, matplotlib>=3.7
- Improved mypy configuration with stricter type checking and per-module overrides
- Updated development documentation (CLAUDE.md, CONTRIBUTING.md) to reflect current tooling
- Expanded test matrix to Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- Consolidated CI workflows: removed redundant PR-test.yml and linting.yml in favor of release.yml
- Simplified CI from conda-based to pip-based installation (faster builds)
- Enhanced black configuration to target Python 3.10-3.13
- Updated ReadTheDocs to use Python 3.10

### Fixed
- Outdated release instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md (removed setup.py references)
- Deprecation warning in `minimum_phase_decomposition.py`: Changed `xp.linalg.linalg.LinAlgError` to `xp.linalg.LinAlgError` for compatibility with NumPy 2.0+
